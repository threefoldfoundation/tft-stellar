# Funding TFT transactions

## Problem

Transaction fees for TFT on the Stellar platform should be paid in Lumen (XLM) and not in TFT.
It is uncomfortable for users to require and purchase Lumen to be able to do TFT transactions.

## Solution

A funding service accepts transaction envelopes and funds the required lumen.

The funding service adds a payment operation of 0.1 of the token being transferred to itself and then it's up to the client to accept it or not.

This way transaction fees stay in the same token.

## Stellar signatures

In Stellar, there is the notion of a transaction and a transaction envelope. The transaction contains all information and the transaction envelope contains the transaction + the required signatures.

Signatures are made over hash(network id, transaction envelope type identifier,serialized transaction).

This means that signatures can only be added if the complete transaction is already constructed.

## External Funding flow

Given the way how signatures work, the transaction needs to be complete before anything can be signed. As a consequence, the client needs to know the funding service's details, even with the sequence number which might cause problems.

It's easier is to have the funding service fill in the source account,sign the transaction envelope and give it back to the client. The client needs to verify if everything is still correct (nothing else has been tempered with), sign and publish it.

### Remarks

Since the funding service overwrites the source account of the transaction, the client needs to put it's account on the operation itself.

If the returned transaction is not submitted to the stellar network within the minute, the funding account might be reused, making the returned transaction envelope obsolete.

## Implementations

An implementation of the funding service is [available as a Jumpscale service](../ThreeBotPackages/transactionfunding-service/readme.md).
