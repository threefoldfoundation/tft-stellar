## How do I check the timelocked tokens of an account?

You can use the js-sdk stellar client getbalance method or if that is too technical, use the statistics service to get information about a specific account.

<https://statsdata.threefoldtoken.com/stellar_stats/api/account/address> (Replace address with the actual Stellar adress off course)

The response is json but should be pretty clear.
