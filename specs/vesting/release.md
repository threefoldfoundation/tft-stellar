# Releasing vested TFT

We are abandoning the vesting scheme and returning all vested TFT's back to the owners.

Let's just prepare the unvest transactions (send all of the TFT back to the owner), have them signed by the cosigners and make them available. The owner then has to sign it too and submit it to the Stellar network.
