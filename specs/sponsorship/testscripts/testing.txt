  After sending 1 xlm and removing the trustline the result stays the same.

  Trying an account merge to remove the account gives a stellar `{"transaction":"tx_internal_error"}` error. 
  This is a known bug: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/issues/2914

  According to the bug report:
  "The workaround for Account Merge is to first transfer sufficient quantity of Lumens to remove sponsorship, revoke sponsorship, then perform Account Merge"

  Revoking sponsorship needs to be done by the sponsoring account though.
