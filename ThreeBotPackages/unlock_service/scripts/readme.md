# Unlock service scripts

For the `restore.py` and the `export.py` scripts you need to be in a js-sdk environment.

The export script fetches the used unlocktransactions from the unlock service for TFT and TFTA using the Stellar network as input. No special setup is needed to acquire access to the unlockservice's resources. they are exported over the public api.
