# Testnet reset

While the [commands](./commands.md) list all commands needed to set up testnet TFT and related services through jsng which requires having the private keys, most accounts can be reactivated without having the private keys.

Account activation is done through friendbot: <https://friendbot.stellar.org/?addr=Stellaraddress>

Following accounts have to be reactivated after a testnet reset:

- TFT issuer: GA47YZA3PKFUZMPLQ3B5F2E3CJIB57TGGU7SPCQT2WAEYKN766PWIMB3

- TX funding wallet: GAKONCKYJ7PRRKBZSWVPG3MURUNX4H44AB3CU2YGVKF2FD7KXJBB3XID
